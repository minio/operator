# MinIO Operator Reference [![Slack](https://slack.min.io/slack?type=svg)](https://slack.min.io)

This document explains the various fields supported by MinIO Operator and its CRD's and how to use these fields to deploy and access MinIO server clusters.

MinIO Operator creates native Kubernetes resources within the cluster. If the Tenant is named as `tenant`, resources and their names as created by MinIO Operator are:

- Headless Service: `tenant-hl-svc`
- StatefulSet: `tenant`
- Secret: `tenant-tls` (If `requestAutoCert` is enabled)
- CertificateSigningRequest: `tenant-csr` (If `requestAutoCert` is enabled)

## Tenant Fields

| Field                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| kind                       | This defines the resource type to be created. MinIO Operator CRD defines the `kind` for MinIO server as `Tenant`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| metadata                   | This field allows a way to assign metadata to a Tenant. Internally `metadata` is a struct type as [explained here](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1#ObjectMeta).                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| scheduler                  | Set custom scheduler for pods created by MinIO Operator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| spec.metadata              | Define the object metadata to be passed to all the members pods of this Tenant. This allows adding annotations and labels. For example,you can add Prometheus annotations here. Internally  `metadata` is a struct type as [explained here](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1#ObjectMeta).                                                                           |
| spec.image                 | Set the container registry and image tag for MinIO server to be used in the Tenant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| spec.pools                 | Set the number of servers per MinIO Pool. Add a new Pool field to expand the MinIO cluster. Read more on [MinIO pools here](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/docs/distributed/DESIGN.md).                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| spec.volumesPerServer      | Set the number of volume mounts per MinIO node. For example if you set `spec.pools[0].Servers = 4`, `spec.pools[1].Servers = 8` and `spec.volumesPerServer = 4`, then you'll have total 12 MinIO Pods, with 4 volume mounts on each Pod. Note that  `volumesPerServer` is static per cluster, expanding a cluster will add new nodes.                                                     |
| spec.imagePullSecret       | Defines the secret to be used for pull image from a private Docker image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
