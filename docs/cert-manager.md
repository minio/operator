# TLS Certificate management with Cert Manager  [![Slack](https://slack.min.io/slack?type=svg)](https://slack.min.io)

This document explains how to deploy MinIO Operator and a MinIO Tenant using certificates generated by [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/).

On a Kubernetes cluster, Certificate Manager requires a global level `Cluster Issuer` to generate intermediary Issuers and certificates.
At the namespace level, Cert Manager issues certificates derived from an `Issuer`.
The main difference between a `Cluster Issuer` and a `Issuer` is that `Cluster Issuer` can Issue certificates for several
namespaces and an `Issuer` can only issue them in a single namespace.

To learn more about Cert Manager Issuers refer to their documentation https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/.

Below is a logical view of a Kubernetes cluster:

![Cert-manager-namespaces.png](images%2FCert-manager-namespaces.png)

This cluster contains 4 namespaces:

- minio-operator
- tenant-1
- tenant-2
- other-namespace

This guide shows you how to set up different Certificate Authorities (CA) in each namespace, all of them referencing a global `Cluster Issuer`.

![Cert-manager Issuers.png](images%2FCert-manager%20Issuers.png)

Cert Manager is installed in the `cert-manager` namespace.

The global `Cluster Issuer` is created in the default namespace.

A local `Issuer` is created in each tenant namespace.

An `Issuer` is also created in the `minio-operator` namespace. More about services that require TLS certificates
in the `minio-operator` namespace are covered below in [MinIO Operator services with cert-manager](# MinIO Operator services with cert-manager).

> [!NOTE]  
> This guide uses a self-signed `Cluster Issuer`. You can also use [other Issuers supported by Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/issuers/).
> The main difference is that you must provide the `Issuer` CA certificate to minio, instead of the CA's mentioned in this guide.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes version `+v1.21`. While cert-manager
  supports [earlier K8s versions](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/supported-releases/), MinIO Operator requires 1.21 or later.
- [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) installed
- `kubectl` access to your `k8s` cluster

### Setup Cert-manager

Install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.12/) 1.12.X LTS is preferred,
or install latest, for example using kubectl.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.12.9/cert-manager.yaml
```

For more details on the Cert Manager refer to https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/.

### Create Cluster Self-signed root Issuer

The `Cluster Issuer` is the cluster level Issuer all other certificates are derived from. Request Cert Manager to
generate this by creating a `ClusterIssuer` resource:

```yaml
# selfsigned-root-clusterissuer.yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-root
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f selfsigned-root-clusterissuer.yaml
```

# MinIO Operator services with cert-manager

MinIO Operator manages the TLS certificate issuing for the services hosted in the `minio-operator` namespace. These include Secure Token Service `sts` and the Console `console` service.

This section describes how to generate the `sts` and `console` TLS certificates with Cert Manager.
These certificates must be issued before installing Operator.
Be sure to follow step [Create Cluster Self-signed root Issuer ](#Create Cluster Self-signed root Issuer) mentioned above.

## Secure Token Service (STS)

MinIO STS is a service included with MinIO Operator that provides Native IAM Authentication for Kubernetes. In essence
this service allows you to control access to your MinIO tenant from your kubernetes applications without having to explicitly create credentials
for each application. For more information on the Service see the MinIO docs at https://min.io/docs/minio/kubernetes/upstream/developers/sts-for-operator.html.
There is also an [STS](https://github.com/minio/operator/blob/master/docs/STS.md) guide in the docs and example client code in
https://github.com/minio/operator/tree/master/examples/kustomization/sts-example.

For the purpose of this guide, STS Service can be considered a webserver presented with a TLS certificate for https traffic.
This guide covers how to **disable** the automatic generation of the certificate in MinIO Operator and issue the certificate using
Cert Manager instead.

## Console service

The console service is the well known UI provided by Operator, it looks like the image below:

![console-dashboard.png](images%2Fconsole-dashboard.png)

When you install MinIO Operator, by default the Console service comes with TLS disabled. This guide explains
how to issue the TLS certificate for this service with Cert Manager and enable TLS for https traffic.

### Create minio-operator namespace CA Issuer

To create the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate used to issue certificates for services in the `minio-operator` 
namespace, first create the `Issuer`:

```yaml
# minio-operator-ca-issuer.yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: minio-operator-ca-issuer
  namespace: minio-operator
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: operator-ca-tls
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f minio-operator-ca-issuer.yaml
```
Next, request a Certificate with `spec.isCA: true` specified. This is our CA for the `minio-operator` namespace.

```yaml
# operator-ca-tls-secret.yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: minio-operator-ca-certificate
  namespace: minio-operator
spec:
  isCA: true
  commonName: operator
  secretName: operator-ca-tls
  duration: 70128h # 8y
  privateKey:
    algorithm: ECDSA
    size: 256
  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned-root
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    group: cert-manager.io
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f operator-ca-tls-secret.yaml
```
A new secret with the name `operator-ca-tls` is created in the `minio-operator` namespace.
This is the CA issuing TLS certificates for the services in the `minio-operator` namespace. MinIO Operator copies this secret, using the same name (`operator-ca-tls`), into all the Tenant namespaces and keeps the secret contents in sync.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to trust this certificate in your applications that need to interact with either the `console` or the `sts` service.

### Create TLS certificate for STS service

Request Cert Manager to issue a new certificate containing following DNS domains:

```shell
sts
sts.minio-operator.svc.
sts.minio-operator.svc.<cluster domain>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace `<cluster domain>` with the actual values for your MinIO tenant.
> `cluster domain` is the internal root DNS domain assigned in your Kubernetes cluster. Typically this is `cluster.local`, check on your coredns
> configuration for the correct value for your Kubernetes cluster. For example, using `kubectl get configmap coredns -n kube-system -oyaml | yq ".data"`. 
> The way the root DNS domain is managed can vary depending on the Kubernetes distribution (Openshift, Rancher, EKS, etc.)

Create a `Certificate` for the domains mentioned above:

```yaml
# sts-tls-certificate.yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: sts-certmanager-cert
  namespace: minio-operator
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - sts
    - sts.minio-operator.svc
    - sts.minio-operator.svc.cluster.local
  secretName: sts-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: minio-operator-ca-issuer
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f sts-tls-certificate.yaml
```
This creates a secret called `sts-tls` in the `minio-operator` namespace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The secret name is not optional. Make sure the secret name is `sts-tls` by setting `spec.secretName: sts-tls` as in the example above.

### Create TLS certificate for Console service

Request Cert Manager to issue a new certificate including the following DNS domains for console:

```shell
console
console.minio-operator.svc.
console.minio-operator.svc.<cluster domain>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace `<cluster domain>` with the actual values for your MinIO tenant.
> `cluster domain` is the internal root DNS domain assigned in your Kubernetes cluster. Typically this is `cluster.local`, check on your coredns
> configuration for the correct value for your Kubernetes cluster. For example, using `kubectl get configmap coredns -n kube-system -oyaml | yq ".data"`.
> The way the root DNS domain is managed can vary depending on the Kubernetes distribution (Openshift, Rancher, EKS, etc.)

Create a `Certificate` for the domains mentioned above:

```yaml
# console-tls-certificate.yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: console-certmanager-cert
  namespace: minio-operator
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - console
    - console.minio-operator.svc
    - console.minio-operator.svc.cluster.local
  secretName: console-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: minio-operator-ca-issuer
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f console-tls-certificate.yaml
```

This creates a secret called `console-tls` in the `minio-operator` namespace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The secret name is not optional. Make sure the secret name is `console-tls` by setting `spec.secretName: console-tls` as in the example above.

### Install Operator with Auto TLS disabled for STS

When installing the Operator deployment, make sure to set `OPERATOR_STS_AUTO_TLS_ENABLED: off` env variable in the `minio-operator` container. This prevents
MinIO Operator from issuing the certificate for STS and instead wait for you to provide the TLS certificate issued by Cert Manager.

Also make sure to set `MINIO_CONSOLE_TLS_ENABLE: off` env variable, this prevents MinIO Operator from issuing the certificate for Console
and instead will expect you to provide the TLS certificate issued by Cert Manager.

> [!WARNING]
> Failing to provide the secret `sts-tls` containing the TLS certificate or providing an invalid key-pair in the secret will
> prevent the STS service from starting.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: minio-operator
  namespace: minio-operator
spec:
...
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: minio-operator
...
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: minio-operator
      containers:
        - name: minio-operator
          image: minio/operator:v5.0.14
...
          env:
            - name: MINIO_CONSOLE_TLS_ENABLE:
              value: "off"
            - name: OPERATOR_STS_AUTO_TLS_ENABLED
              value: "off"
            - name: OPERATOR_STS_ENABLED
              value: "on"
```

# MinIO tenant TLS certificates with cert-manager

## Create tenant-1 namespace CA Issuer

To create the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate in the namespace `tenant-1`, first create the `Issuer`:

```yaml
# tenant-1-ca-issuer.yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: tenant-1-ca-issuer
  namespace: tenant-1
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: tenant-1-ca-secret
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f tenant-1-ca-issuer.yaml
```

Next, request a Certificate with `spec.isCA: true` specified:

```yaml
# tenant-1-ca-certificate.yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: tenant-1-ca-certificate
  namespace: tenant-1
spec:
  isCA: true
  commonName: tenant-1-ca
  secretName: tenant-1-ca-secret
  duration: 70128h # 8y
  privateKey:
    algorithm: ECDSA
    size: 256
  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned-root
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    group: cert-manager.io
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f tenant-1-ca-certificate.yaml
```

## Deploy the tenant 

### Create a certificate for Tenant

Request Cert Manager issue a new TLS server certificate for MinIO that includes the following DNS domains:

```shell
minio.<namespace>
minio.<namespace>.svc
minio.<namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>
*.<tenant-name>-hl.<namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>
*.<namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace `<cluster domain>` with the actual values for your MinIO tenant.
> * `cluster domain` is the internal root DNS domain assigned in your Kubernetes cluster. Typically this is `cluster.local`, check on your coredns
> configuration for the correct value for your Kubernetes cluster. For example, using `kubectl get configmap coredns -n kube-system -oyaml | yq ".data"`.
> The way the root DNS domain is managed can vary depending on the Kubernetes distribution (Openshift, Rancher, EKS, etc.)
> * `tenant-name` is the name provided to your tenant in the `metadata.name` of the Tenant YAML. For this example it is `myminio`.
> * `namespace` is the namespace where the tenant is created, the `metadata.namespace` notes that in the Tenant YAML. For this example it is `tenant-1`.

Create a `Certificate` for the domains mentioned above:

```yaml
# tenant-1-minio-certificate.yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: tenant-certmanager-cert
  namespace: tenant-1
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - "minio.tenant-1"
    - "minio.tenant-1.svc"
    - '*.minio-tenant-1.svc.cluster.local'
    - '*.minio.tenant-1.svc.cluster.local'
    - '*.myminio-hl.tenant-1.svc.cluster.local'
  secretName: myminio-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: tenant-certmanager-issuer
```

> [!TIP]
> For this example, the Tenant name is `myminio`. We recommend naming the secret in the field `spec.secretName` as `<tenant name>-tls`, following the naming
> convention MinIO Operator uses when creates certificates with Autocert enabled (`spec.requestAutoCert: true`).

```shell
kubectl apply -f tenant-1-minio-certificate.yaml
```

### Configure the tenant to use the certificate created by cert-manager 

In the tenant spec, do the following:

* Disable Autocert `spec.requestAutoCert: false`. This instructs Operator to not attempt to issue certificates and instead rely on Cert Manager to provide them in a secret.
* Reference the Secret containing the TLS certificate from the previous step in `spec.externalCertSecret`.

The `Tenant` section should look like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: minio.min.io/v2
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: myminio
  namespace: tenant-1
spec:
  ## Disable default tls certificates.
  requestAutoCert: false
  ## Use certificates generated by cert-manager.
  externalCertSecret:
    - name: myminio-tls
      type: cert-manager.io/v1
```

## Trust tenant-1 CA in MinIO Operator

MinIO Operator can trust as many CA certificates as provided. To do this, create a secret with the prefix `operator-ca-tls-` 
followed by a unique identifier in the `minio-operator` namespace.

MinIO Operator mounts and trusts all certificates issued by the provided CA's. This is required because
MinIO Operator performs health checks using the */minio/health/cluster* endpoint.

If Operator is not correctly configured to trust the MinIO Certificate (or its CA), you will see an error message like the following in the Operator Pod logs:

```error
Failed to get cluster health: Get "https://minio.tenant-1.svc.cluster.local/minio/health/cluster":
x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```
For more details about health checks, see https://min.io/docs/minio/Kubernetes/upstream/operations/monitoring/healthcheck-probe.html#cluster-write-quorum.

### Create `operator-ca-tls-tenant-1` secret

Copy the Cert Manager generated CA public key (ca.crt) into the minio-operator namespace. This allows Operator to trust
the cert-manager issued CA and the derived certificates.

Create a `ca.crt` file containing the CA:
```sh
kubectl get secrets -n tenant-1 tenant-1-ca-tls -o=jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ca.crt
```

Create the secret:
```sh
kubectl create secret generic operator-ca-tls-tenant1 --from-file=ca.crt -n minio-operator
```
> [!TIP]
> In this example we choose a secret name of `operator-ca-tls-tenant-1`. Note the tenant namespace
> `tenant-1` is used as as suffix for easy identification of which namespace the CA is coming from.

Restart `minio-operator` to apply the changes.

```sh
kubectl rollout restart deployment.apps/minio-operator -n minio-operator
```
