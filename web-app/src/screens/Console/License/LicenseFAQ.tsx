      <h2>What is the GNU AGPL v3?</h2>
      <p>
        The GNU AGPL v3 is short for the "GNU Affero General Public License v3."
        It is a common open source license certified by the Free Software
        Foundation and the Open Source Initiative. You can get a copy of the GNU
        AGPL v3 license with MinIO source code or at&nbsp;
        <LinkElement
          href={"https://min.io/compliance?ref=op"}
          target={"_blank"}
        >
          https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html
        </LinkElement>
        .
      </p>
      <h2>What does it mean for me to comply with the GNU AGPL v3?</h2>
      <p>
        When you host or distribute MinIO over a network, the AGPL v3 applies to
        you. Any distribution or copying of MinIO software modified or not has
        to comply with the obligations specified in the AGPL v3. Otherwise, you
        may risk infringing MinIOâ€™s copyrights.
      </p>
      <h2>Making combined or derivative works of MinIO</h2>
      <p>
        Combining MinIO software as part of a larger software stack triggers
        your GNU AGPL v3 obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The method of combining does not matter. When MinIO is linked to a
        larger software stack in any form, including statically, dynamically,
        pipes, or containerized and invoked remotely, the AGPL v3 applies to
        your use. What triggers the AGPL v3 obligations is the exchanging data
        between the larger stack and MinIO.
      </p>
      <h2>Talking to your Legal Counsel</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions, we recommend that you talk to your own attorney
        for legal advice. Purchasing a commercial license from MinIO removes the
        AGPL v3 obligations from MinIO software.
