    pools:
      ## Servers specifies the number of MinIO Tenant Pods / Servers in this pool.
      ## For standalone mode, supply 1. For distributed mode, supply 4 or more.
      ## Note that the operator does not support upgrading from standalone to distributed mode.
      - servers: 4

        tolerations: { }
        ## nodeSelector parameters for MinIO Pods. It specifies a map of key-value pairs. For the pod to be
        ## eligible to run on a node, the node must have each of the
