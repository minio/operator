  # Specify the Operator container image to use for the deployment.
  # ``image.tag``
  # For example, the following sets the image to the ``quay.io/minio/operator`` repo and the v6.0.1 tag.
  # The container pulls the image if not already present:
  #
  # .. code-block:: yaml
  #
  #    image:
  #      repository: quay.io/minio/operator
  #      tag: v6.0.1
  #      pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  #
  # The chart also supports specifying an image based on digest value:
  #
  # .. code-block:: yaml
  #
  #    image:
  #      repository: quay.io/minio/operator@sha256
  #      digest: 28c80b379c75242c6fe793dfbf212f43c602140a0de5ebe3d9c2a3a7b9f9f983

  # Specify the sidecar container image to deploy on tenant pods for init container and sidecar.
  # Only need to change this if want to use a different version that the default, or want to set a custom registry.
  # ``sidecarImage.tag``
  # For example, the following sets the image to the ``quay.io/minio/operator-sidecar`` repo and the v6.0.1 tag.
  # The container pulls the image if not already present:

  # .. code-block:: yaml
